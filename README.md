## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
AI-Based Fitness Routine Planner

## Description
The AI-Based Fitness Routine Planner is a web application designed to help users create personalized fitness plans tailored to their individual goals, activity levels, dietary preferences, and desired intensity of workouts. By utilizing an AI model, the planner provides users with customized workout and nutrition suggestions that cater to their specific needs.

## Features
Personalized Fitness Plans: Generates tailored plans based on user inputs.
Real-Time Intensity Feedback: Slider input to select workout intensity, with immediate visual updates.
User-Friendly Design: Intuitive interface for seamless navigation.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
